# skin-lesion-segmentation
This project implements a U-Net-based segmentation model for dermoscopic images from the **ISIC 2018 Challenge**.   Developed in **PyTorch** and trained in **Google Colab**, it demonstrates how deep learning can achieve reliable lesion segmentation under limited computational resources.
